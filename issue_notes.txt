# Issues.
1. No result from one-line-block `expr; expt; expr`. Actually this case just uses CaseSeq pattern and SequenceExpr with `;` delimiter.
SequenceExpr doesn't have result.
Fix: Add specific expression for inline-block, resolve conflict with `if expr; condition` case.

2. Expression in parenthesis doesn't return result. Actually it was just grouping operator. But it can be resulting expression. Example: `x -> (expr)`
Fix: MultiOper expression object should return result.
